## Assets

**Feel free to add any new links you find**

Keep track of where you get your assets from
    * Only certain licenses - particularly royalty free - we can ship with
    * If you're using assets without permission, we'll have to replace 'em later (before shipping it)
    * If you have too many assets that aren’t used, please delete them. A project can easily get really bloated and massive due to multiple packages of assets that either aren’t used anymore or only used for a single asset (feel free to download several sets for testing, but delete what you’re not going to use afterwards if you know you’re not going to use them in the near future)

**Unity3D's [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/)**

* Completed games, multiplayer handler scripts, textures, music, you name it
* Not everything is free, but feel free to drop your own money for the team (and hand me the goods for later, personal use)
* Suggestion: Use the search bar with the word “free” (even try just searching “free”)
* When importing assets, they’ll automatically go in the root Assets folder. Remember to move them into your own personal folder, for “just in case” reasons for now
