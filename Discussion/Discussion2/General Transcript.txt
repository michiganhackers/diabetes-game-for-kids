MVP Storyboard Meeting
(Meeting #2)

<General>
-> Split into two separate apps for now, for simplicity (and storyboard was split between these two)
---> Kid's side, done in Unity
---> Parent's side, done natively (due to how simple it would be in native rather than in Unity)
-> Drafted the "necessary" components for our MVP, as well as due dates
-> MVP more or less consists of parent's ability to see kids' data (and set Calorie Counter requirements) and kid's side consists of picking a pet (only a cat for now), being able to choose accessories, and having the need

<Work Split>
-> For beginning (at least until first, 4 day deadline), Spruce works on iOS native Parent's Side, Shayna on Android native Parent's Side, and Jawad on Kid's Side Unity

<Next Meeting>
-> Undecided time, but everyone expressed wish to have another psuedo-meeting at least sometime during Spring Break

<Side Notes>
-> Can fake notifications, server requirements (ie, online syncing, user accounts, etc), and such. May only need to talk about them rather than try to fake them as well (particularly notifications)
